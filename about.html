    <div>
      <p>I'm a senior software engineering student at BYU-Idaho with hands-on experience leading technical teams and building web applications that serve thousands of users worldwide. Currently working as a Senior Developer at the Faculty Technology Center, I work on a team of 2-5 developers supporting online course development and have automated data collection systems that drive strategic decisions.</p>
      
      <p>My technical expertise spans full-stack development with JavaScript, Python, C++, and SQL, plus specialized experience in Google Apps Script for workflow automation and API integrations. I've built everything from RPG combat systems and chess engines to a comprehensive D&D campaign management platforms using React, Flask, and SQLite.</p>
      
      <p>What sets me apart is my combination of technical depth and leadership experience. During my mission service, I managed digital marketing across 15+ cities and led data-driven social media strategies. This foundation in communication and analytical thinking now enhances my ability to collaborate cross-functionally and translate complex technical solutions into business value.</p>
      
      <p>I'm passionate about creating software that makes people's lives easier through thoughtful automation and clean, maintainable code. Currently seeking opportunities in backend or full-stack development where I can contribute to meaningful projects while continuing to grow as both a developer and technical leader.</p>
